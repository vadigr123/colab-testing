## Notes
- **URL Format**: Ensure URLs are valid and accessible. The script uses `wget` for downloads.
- **Hugging Face**: Requires a valid API token with write access to the repository.
- **GitHub**: Requires a Personal Access Token with `repo` scope.
- **Error Handling**: The script assumes basic functionality; add error handling for production use (e.g., checking if URLs are valid or if files already exist).
